changes: 
  - bugfix: "Rolling a 6 with a die of fate now reduces your speed as intended."
  - bugfix: "Rolling an 8 with a die of fate will cause the explosion to be
around the roller, not the die."
  - tweak: "Die of fate effects now make loud visible messages so it's
obvious what has happened."
  - admin: "Dice can now be \"totally rigged\" with admin edits to
unconditionally always roll a certain value, rather than just some of
the time. A new \"cursed die of fate\" has been added to demonstrate this
effect."
  - admin: "Added the \"stealth\" die of fate, both one use and unlimited. You know,
for badminry."
